| **Liquid Level** | Current liquid level | % |
| **Temperature** | Liquid temperature | ¬∞C |
| **Level** | Measurement value | m |
| **WiFi RSSI** | WiFi signal strength | dBm |
| **Pump Total Runs** | Lifetime pump cycles | - |
| **Pump Total Runtime** | Lifetime pump operation time | min |
| **Uptime** | Device uptime | s |
| **Error** | Device error status | - |
| **Firmware** | Firmware version | - |
| **Measurement Age** | Time since last measurement | s |

## Services

### Start Measurement

Trigger a new measurement on the device.

```yaml
service: liquid_check.start_measure
target:
  device_id: your_device_id
```

### Restart Device

Restart the Liquid Check device remotely.

```yaml
service: liquid_check.restart
target:
  device_id: your_device_id
```

## Example Automations

### Low Liquid Level Alert

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Low Liquid Level Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.water_tank_liquid_level
        below: 20
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Water tank level is below 20%!"
```

### Daily Measurement Trigger

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Daily Tank Measurement"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "08:00:00"
    action:
      - service: liquid_check.start_measure
        target:
          device_id: your_device_id
```

### Weekly Device Restart

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Weekly Device Restart"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "03:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: time
        weekday:
          - sun
    action:
      - service: liquid_check.restart
        target:
          device_id: your_device_id
```

## Troubleshooting

**Integration not showing in Add Integration:**
- Restart Home Assistant after installation
- Check that files are in `config/custom_components/liquid_check/`
- Check Home Assistant logs for errors

**Cannot connect to device:**
- Verify the IP address is correct
- Ensure device is on the same network
- Check firewall settings

**Sensors show unavailable:**
- Check device is powered on and connected
- Verify IP address hasn't changed
- Check Home Assistant logs for connection errors
